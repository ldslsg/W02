# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: SeungGyu Lee

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |      X        |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below: 

* Manifest: This is a JSON file that contains important metadata about your extension1. It’s the only required file that must have a specific file name: manifest.json1.
* Service Workers: These run in the background and handle browser events1. They don’t have access to the DOM, but you can combine it with an offscreen document for this use case1.
* Content Scripts: These are scripts that run JavaScript in the context of a web page1.
* Toolbar Action: This allows you to execute code when the user clicks on the extension toolbar icon or show a popup using the Action API1.
* Side Panel: This allows you to display custom UI in the browser’s side panel1.
* DeclarativeNetRequest: This allows you to intercept, block, or modify network requests1.


### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? YouTube and ChatGPT

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? Test it before publish

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)? Making a canvas calender adjustment module.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module. 
* Monday thru Fridays
* Mon-Wed-Fri sometime during 12 pm - 6 pm, Tue-Thurs during 1 pm - 4pm 
* My room, couch, or library.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

**Technical Risk:**
- **Risk:** One technical risk could be the integration of new features or systems. There's always a risk that new code could have unforeseen impacts on existing functionality, leading to bugs or system instability.
- **Mitigation Plan:** To mitigate this, it's important to have robust testing procedures in place. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Additionally, code reviews can help catch potential issues before they're merged into the main codebase. It's also beneficial to have a rollback plan in case issues do arise after deployment.

**Behavioral Risk:**
- **Risk:** A common behavioral risk is burnout. If I am consistently working long hours or under high stress, I may become fatigued, which can lead to reduced productivity, mistakes, and low morale.
- **Mitigation Plan:** To mitigate this risk, it's important to monitor workload. Encouraging a healthy work-life balance eating well and go workout during a day.



## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|

|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|Y       |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |N in the future I will add more.       |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |Y        |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |Y  |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:
